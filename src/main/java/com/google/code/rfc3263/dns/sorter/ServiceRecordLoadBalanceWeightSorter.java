	 * Algorithm from RFC 2782
	 *
	 *         To select a target to be contacted next, arrange all SRV RRs
	 *         (that have not been ordered yet) in any order, except that all
	 *         those with weight 0 are placed at the beginning of the list.
	 *
	 *         Compute the sum of the weights of those RRs, and with each RR
	 *         associate the running sum in the selected order. Then choose a
	 *         uniform random number between 0 and the sum computed
	 *         (inclusive), and select the RR whose running sum value is the
	 *         first in the selected order which is greater than or equal to
	 *         the random number selected. The target host specified in the
	 *         selected SRV RR is the next one to be contacted by the client.
	 *         Remove this SRV RR from the set of the unordered SRV RRs and
	 *         apply the described algorithm to the unordered SRV RRs to select
	 *         the next target host.  Continue the ordering process until there
	 *         are no unordered SRV RRs.
